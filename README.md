# Flask Authentication System

This is a basic authentication system built with **Flask**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It allows users to register, log in, and access a secure page. 
To use this project, first install Python and Flask, clone the repository, and run the `app.py` file. 
The app includes a home page, a registration form for creating new accounts, a login form for logging in, and a secured page that can only be accessed after a successful login. 
All pages are styled using simple CSS for a clean, professional look.
